I have published an article on Medium explaining the process. Here is the [link](https://medium.com/swlh/a-simple-way-to-explore-the-netflix-content-using-tableau-5b06e17e443)

### Technologies
Project is created with:
* Alteryx
* Tableau
* [Netflix content dataset](https://github.com/sruthi1014/Netflix-Content-Analysis--Tableau-Alteryx/blob/master/netflix_titles.csv)


### Approach:
1. Data Transformation- Alteryx <br>
    The dataset has each movie/tv show with their details. The country column has all the countries a movie/show was released. Using Alteryx, I have transformed the data in Country column which will help to find the country wise total releases.  Similarly, genre column was transformed which helps in finding the top most genres in movies or tv shows till date.
